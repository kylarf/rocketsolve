Dependencies:
 - gnuplot (must be installed and on path as gnuplot)
 - C compiler that supports C11 or newer and GNU extensions

To compile, run "make" from the top-level directory (above src, data).

Main executable "rocketsolve" will be placed in newly created "build" directory
alongside object files.

To run, invoke as follows:

rocketsolve [input-file] [geometry-file] [data-dir]

[input-file] and [geometry-file] are the respective paths to the input parameter
and nozzle geometry (r vs x) files. [data-dir] is the path to the *directory*
into which output data files and plots should be written (filenames fixed; will
overwrite if already exist). [data-dir] already exist at time of execution.
